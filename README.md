# CrypAutool
#### A tool designed to automatically recognize some classic cryptography and encodings, including brute forcing some common hashes.
#### The charts shows the recursive results in a concrete way, which may be helpful for education.
#### A Database is needed to bruteforce hashes, you can find the tool I use to create database using Qt5 [here](https://github.com/Houwenda/programming/tree/master/Qt5/sqlite) .
#### Due to the absolute paths in the program, it cannot be boxed yet.
### Noticeï¼šThis tool can be used for educational purposes, but is not qualified for cryptography research or cracking.
